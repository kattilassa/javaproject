# ContactsApp

ContactsApp is an application where users can create, read, update and delete Finnish contacts. Contacts are stored in a persistent text file.
# Motivation

ContactsApp serves as a final project for the Introduction to programming course. My motivation for this program was to learn to work with persistent text files, improve my Java coding skills and the quality of my code.
